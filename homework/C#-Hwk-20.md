1. What is a delegate? Explain delegates in terms of pointers and reference types.
  - A delegate is a reference to a method.
1. How do you declare a delegate? Include a discussion of types, return values, names, and parameters.
  - DelegateName variablename = new DelegateName();
1. How do you create instances of delegates and assign values to the instance? What are the values?
  - Del delegate = DelegateMethod
1. How do you invoke a method that has been added to a delegate?
  - Delegate.MethodInvoke(value);
1. What is an event? Why do we have events?
  - An event enables a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs.
  - We have events in GUI programming such as UWP apps; events are used to run code when the user clicks a button or types something in a field.
1. How do you declare events?
  - event delegateTypeName eventName
1. How do delegates recognize event subscriptions? How do you unsubscribe an event from a delegate?
  - Delegates recognize event subscriptions by attaching the delegate instance to the event by using the += operator.
  class MyEventHandlingClass
    - {
    - private MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
    -  ...
    -  public void Start()
    -   {
    -  myClass.MyEvent +=
    -  new myClass.MyDelegate (this.eventHandlingMethod);
    -  }
    -  private void eventHandlingMethod()
    -  {
    -  ...
    -  }
      }
You can also
  - Use the -= operator instead of using the += operator
1. How do you raise an event? How do you declare code that raises an event?
  - Use the same syntax as a method call. You must supply arguments to match the type of
the parameters expected by the delegate referenced by the event. Donâ€™t forget to check whether the event is null. For example:
    - class MyClass
    - {
    - public event myDelegate MyEvent;
    - ...
    - private void RaiseEvent()
    - {
    - if (this.MyEvent != null)
    - {
    - this.MyEvent();
    - }
    - }
    - ...
    - }
1. Explain with specificity what happens when an event fires and that event has been attached to a delegate
  - Delegate type events are generated whose signature has a voide return type with two arguments.  The first argument is the sender, and the second event is an EventArgs argument.
